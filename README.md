# Frontend project - bookshare
## Description

I built this simple frontend to learn how to get data from any API and how to handle JSON.
For the frontend area I am using currently:

<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
<li>Vanilla JS</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
</ul>

In future I want to customize this project to connect it with the Java Spring Boot backend project, that you can find <a href="https://github.com/BS-Igor/bookshare-java-backend" target="_blank">here</a>.
